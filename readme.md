#Sample webpack example
> A Sample project to understand webpack configuration and dependencies

## Steps used

``` bash

# Initilize npm
npm init

# Install npm 
npm install

# Install webpack
npm install --save-dev webpack

# Update Engines in package.json [Optinally]
"node": ">= 7.10.0",
"npm": ">= 4.2.0"
I have kept above version just to be sure that every things works fine on these versions as these are currently installed in my machine :D

```

## Why some are dev dependency ?
> Because those are needed only for build time not for run time in app.
